        <p>This repository provides COVID-19 vaccination statistics in machine-readable format.  You can learn more in the <a href="https://github.com/jxeeno/aust-govt-covid19-vaccine-pdf">repository readme</a>.</p>
        <p>Documentation for this data will be improved in due course.  In the meantime:</p>
        <p>
            To access the data programatically, access the index JSON file at <tt>https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/publications.json</tt>.  This will list all the PDF files published by the Department of Health.  Entries with a <tt>vaccineDataPath</tt> entry have been parsed correctly and contain vaccination statistics which can be accessed via the provided URL.
