        <p>This repository provides COVID-19 vaccination statistics in machine-readable format.  You can learn more in the <a href="https://github.com/jxeeno/aust-govt-covid19-vaccine-pdf">repository readme</a>.</p>
        <p>Documentation for this data will be improved in due course.  In the meantime, you can access the data with the following URLs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSV (all): <a href="https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/all.csv">https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/all.csv</a></li>
            <li>JSON (all): <a href="https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/all.json">https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/all.json</a></li>
            <li>Raw JSON data (index): <a href="https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/publications.json">https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/publications.json</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For the "all" data, the <tt>VALIDATED</tt> column will have a value of <tt>Y</tt> if our data validation checks were successful for that PDF file (i.e. all expected values were extracted and totals add up to their constituents parts).
        </p>
        <p>
            To access the raw JSON data programatically, access the index JSON file at <tt>https://vaccinedata.covid19nearme.com.au/data/publications.json</tt>.  This will list all the PDF files published by the Department of Health.  Entries with a <tt>vaccineDataPath</tt> entry have been parsed correctly and contain vaccination statistics which can be accessed via the provided URL.
